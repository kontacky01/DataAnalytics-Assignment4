# DataAnalytics-Assignment4<br>
FALL2023<br>
assignment to explore concepts of machine learning using at least two learning models (in my case i used linear regression and random forest regressor models)<br>
and evaluating how accurate their predictions are (i used Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), R-squared (RÂ²) or Coefficient of Determination) to meausure accuracy<br>
for the datasets i was working with, random forest regressor seems to make better predictions in comparison to linear regression)
